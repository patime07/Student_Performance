# Students Performance Analysis

## Overview

The "student-performance.ipynb" notebook explores student performance data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization techniques. The dataset used "Students_Performance_Data.numbers" contains 1000 test scores (Math/ Reading/ Writing) from (female/male) students of different races/ethnicities. 

## Contents

The notebook is divided into 5 parts, each answering a different question: 

1- Are there subjects where a gender is better than the other?

2- Is there a relationship between race/ethnicity and test score ?

3- How effective the test preparation course is ?

4- Does the level of education of parents impact their children's performance ?

5- At what extent can the lunch taken before a test affect the student performance ?
